# **Hi, I'm Willllllliam**

I like making games, music, Discord bots, weird things, or any combination of those.
I use Replit to house my Discord bots: https://replit.com/@Willllllliam

### Some of my current/upcoming projects include:
- DisTopia Game Engine, a game engine where all the development and playing is done within Discord (Discord bot game)
- MIDI Calculator, the union of a TI-83+ and an Arduino that turns the button presses on the calculator into MIDI signals going into a computer via USB. (weird music thing)
